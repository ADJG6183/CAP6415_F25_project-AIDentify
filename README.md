### AI-Generated Content Detection System  

AIDentify is an open-source project designed to detect and classify AI-generated content across text, images, and other media formats.  
By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning models, AIDentify helps users determine whether a piece of content was created by a human or an AI system.
